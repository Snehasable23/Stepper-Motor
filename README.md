# Stepper-Motor   
Stepper motors are DC motors that move in discrete steps. They have multiple coils that are organized in groups called "phases". By energizing each phase in sequence, the motor will rotate, one step at a time. With a computer controlled stepping you can achieve very precise positioning and/or speed control.
stepper motor control using both of assembly code and c language at proteus platform. stepper motor is interfacing with 8086  Âµp using ULN2003A Transistor Array , 8255A PPI and 74HC373 Latch ,simulated in proteus 8.6 and programmed by EMU8086.
